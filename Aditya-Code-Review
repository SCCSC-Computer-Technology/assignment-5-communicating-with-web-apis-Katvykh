Nice, the API Works runs but there are couple of issues when I tested it out:

  Under POST /api/state - I tried executing the application/json, but retrived no relating data.

  Curl:
      curl -X 'POST' \
      'https://localhost:7112/api/State' \
      -H 'accept: text/plain' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/*+json' \
      -d '{
      "stateID": 0,
      "state": "string",
      "capital": "string",
      "population": 0,
      "flagDescription": "string",
      "flower": "string",
      "bird": "string",
      "colors": "string",
      "largestCities": "string",
      "medianIncome": {
        "value": 0
      },
      "percCompRelatedJobs": 0
    }'

Even when I tested the Request URL (https://localhost:7112/api/State): It gave me error of States.MedianIncome, it could not be mapped beacuse it is of type 'SqlMoney', 
                                                                       which is not a supported primitve type or a valid entity type.

And this the Server response I recived.
  Error: response status is 500

Same errors to others to "Get", "Put", "Delete".

From the Web-App end, I got an Authentication Exception: The remote certificate is invalid because of errors in the certificate chain: Untrusted.
